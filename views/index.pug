      p Pug is a template engine implemented in javascript using node. It compiles into standard HTML. Pug relies on indention rather than opening and closing tags to create elements. Pug was formally known as Jade.

    //- pug will let you reuse pug files as templates
    //- for example you could create a header file and reuse
    //- that file on multiple pug files  --include <filepath>

    //- to make multiple paragraphs back to back you can use pipes |
